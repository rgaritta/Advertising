# AdExtensionDetailReportColumn Value Set - Reporting
Defines the attributes and performance statistics columns that you can include in the [AdExtensionDetailReportRequest](adextensiondetailreportrequest.md).

The attribute columns that you include in a report can affect how the statistics are aggregated. In other words the number of rows increase by a factor of the unique attributes. For more information, see [Columns that Group the Data](../guides/reports.md#columnsdata).

For a list of columns that you must include, please see the [Required Columns](#requiredcolumns) section below.

To see how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report, see [Report Data Retention Time Periods](../guides/report-data-retention-time-periods.md).
