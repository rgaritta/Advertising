# Campaign Radius Criterion Record - Bulk
Defines a campaign radius criterion that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file.

With radius criterions, you can choose to show ads to potential customers in, searching for, or viewing pages about a specified radius around a zip code, coordinates, landmark, or area.

Each radius criterion defines a radius, latitude, and longitude for the accompanying criterion bid adjustment. 

The maximum number of radius criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is 2,000.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only have one [Campaign Location Intent Criterion](campaign-location-intent-criterion.md) record per campaign to determine the location intent option that applies for all of the campaign's [Campaign Location Criterion](campaign-location-criterion.md) and [Campaign Radius Criterion](campaign-radius-criterion.md) records. When you create the campaign's first criterion, a [Campaign Location Intent Criterion](campaign-location-intent-criterion.md) record will also be added automatically with the default *Target* set to *PeopleInOrSearchingForOrViewingPages*. You can add or update a campaign's [Campaign Location Intent Criterion](campaign-location-intent-criterion.md), whether or not the campaign has any other criterions. You cannot delete a campaign's [Campaign Location Intent Criterion](campaign-location-intent-criterion.md), although it has no purpose without location or radius criterions. 

If ad group level radius criterions are specified, the campaign level radius criterions are ignored for that ad group. In other words the ad group radius criterions override the campaign radius criterions, and are not applied as a union.

Also note that you must consider the location, negative location, and radius criterions as a set of *geo criterions*. If the ad group has any geo criterions, then none of the campaign's geo criterions are inherited. If the ad group doesn't have any geo criterions, then all of the campaign's geo criterions are inherited. The geo criterions can be inherited from the campaign even if the ad group has a location intent criterion. If the ad group's geo criterions are used, then the ad group's location intent criterion is used; if the campaign's geo criterions are inherited, then the campaign's location intent criterion is used and the ad group's location intent criterion is ignored. You cannot delete a campaign or ad group's location intent criterion, although it has no purpose without location or radius criterions. 

> [!TIP]
> For an overview of how to use target criterions, see [Show Ads to Your Target Audience](../guides/show-ads-target-audience.md).

You can download all *Campaign Radius Criterion* records in the account by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *CampaignTargetCriterions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [EntityData](datascope.md#entitydata) scope. For more details about the Bulk service including best practices, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new campaign radius criterion if a valid [Parent Id](#parentid) value is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Sub Type,Campaign,Client Id,Modified Time,Target,Bid Adjustment,Name,Radius,Unit,From Hour,From Minute,To Hour,To Minute,Latitude,Longitude
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,6.0,,,,,,,,
Campaign Radius Criterion,Active,,-111,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,RadiusName,20,,10,Kilometers,,,,,10.5,40.5
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the [BulkServiceManager](../guides/sdk-bulk-service-manager.md) to upload and download the *BulkCampaignRadiusCriterion* object, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkCampaignRadiusCriterion
var bulkCampaignRadiusCriterion = new BulkCampaignRadiusCriterion
{
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file is read-only
    CampaignName = null,

    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // BiddableCampaignCriterion object of the Campaign Management service.

    CampaignCriterion = new BiddableCampaignCriterion
    {
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        CampaignId = campaignIdKey,

        Criterion = new RadiusCriterion
        {
            // 'Latitude' column header in the Bulk file
            LatitudeDegrees = 10.5,

            // 'Longitude' column header in the Bulk file
            LongitudeDegrees = 40.5,

            // 'Name' column header in the Bulk file
            Name = "RadiusName",

            // 'Radius' column header in the Bulk file
            Radius = 10,

            // 'Unit' column header in the Bulk file
            RadiusUnit = DistanceUnit.Kilometers,
        },

        CriterionBid = new BidMultiplier
        {
            // 'Bid Adjustment' column header in the Bulk file
            Multiplier = 20,
        },

        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,

        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = CampaignCriterionStatus.Active,
    }
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkCampaignRadiusCriterion);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkServiceManager.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```
